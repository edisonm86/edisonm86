I'm an emerging Security Analyst with a background in system administration and platform management. For nearly five years at Merit America, I‚Äôve managed learning platforms supporting IT Support, Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, and more. My focus is on maintaining secure systems, troubleshooting, onboarding users, and improving platform usability.

I hold a B.S. in Cybersecurity Management and Policy from UMGC and a CompTIA Security+ certification. I'm actively building skills in threat detection, malware analysis, and both defensive and offensive security. I enjoy making systems safer and more accessible, and I‚Äôm always open to learning and collaborating.

## Objective
I'm working toward becoming a Security Analyst by building hands-on skills in problem solving and critical thinking. This space is where I‚Äôll track my progress, share projects, and document the practical training I‚Äôm doing to grow in cybersecurity.
