I’m an emerging Security Analyst with a background in system administration and platform management. I’ve spent nearly five years at Merit America as a Technology Systems Coordinator, managing learning platforms that support IT Support, Data Analytics, Cybersecurity, Project Management, and UX/UI programs. My day-to-day work involves maintaining and troubleshooting our LMS, onboarding users, building learning portals, and supporting secure access to educational tools. I enjoy solving problems, improving platform reliability, and helping people gain access to tech careers.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity Management and Policy from the University of Maryland Global Campus and have earned my CompTIA Security+ certification. I'm actively expanding my skills in threat detection, malware analysis, and both offensive and defensive security. I’m always open to learning and collaborating, especially in areas where security meets usability.

## Objective
I'm working toward becoming a Security Analyst by building hands-on skills in problem solving and critical thinking. This space is where I’ll track my progress, share projects, and document the practical training I’m doing to grow in cybersecurity.
